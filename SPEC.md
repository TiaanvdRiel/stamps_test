# Stamps - Travel Tracking App Specification

## Overview
Stamps is a SwiftUI app that helps users track their travel history by marking visited countries and cities on a map. The app features a design similar to Apple Maps, with visited countries outlined and cities marked with pins.

## Current Implementation Status
